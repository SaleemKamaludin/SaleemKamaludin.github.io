I am a lecturer in the **Department of Mathematics and Statistics** at the **University of the West Indies, St. Augustine**.  
My teaching centers on discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and advanced topics in graph theory; my current research focuses on the **Szeged index** and symmetry in graphs.
