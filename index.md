Welcome to my academic site. I am **Saleem Kamaludin**, a mathematician and lecturer with interests in **algebraic topology**,  **discrete mathematics**, **graph theory**, and **combinatorial analysis**.

This site serves as a hub for:
- **[About]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }})** — background and research interests  
- **[Courses]({{ '/courses/' | relative_url }})** — lecture notes and worked solutions  
- Occasional updates and resources for students

---

## Research Interests
My research lies in **graph invariants** and **mathematical chemistry**, with emphasis on the **Szeged index**, cut‑based methods, and the role of symmetry in discrete structures. I also work on **teaching practice** — clear exposition, proof skills, and problem‑solving strategies.

## News & Updates
- **Aug 2025** — Updating *Calculus II* and *Linear Algebra* notes for the new semester.  
- **Jul 2025** — Draft chapter on symmetric graphs and Szeged index completed (thesis work).  
- **Jun 2025** — Pre‑semester problem‑solving boot camp concluded — materials to be posted.

## Featured Mathematics
Mathematics here is written in **LaTeX** and rendered via **MathJax**. For example:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n.
