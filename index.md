# Welcome

Welcome to my academic site. I am **Saleem Kamaludin**, a mathematician and lecturer with interests in **discrete mathematics**, **graph theory**, and **mathematical pedagogy**.  

This site is designed as a hub for:
- **About** — background and research interests  
- **Courses** — lecture notes and worked solutions for my classes  
- Occasional updates and resources for students

### Featured Work
Mathematics is best communicated with clear exposition and rigorous examples. Here you will find carefully prepared solutions, notes, and explorations written with **LaTeX** and rendered online with **MathJax**.

For instance, here is a sample identity that often arises in combinatorics:

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n.
$$
