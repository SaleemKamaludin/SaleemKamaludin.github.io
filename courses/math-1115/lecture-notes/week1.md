### Basic Terms

Sets are the building blocks of mathematics. Before diving into formal definitions, we recall some fundamental ideas and notation.

<ul style="margin-top:0.75rem; line-height:1.7;">
  <li>The notation \( \mathbb{N} \) denotes the <em>set of natural numbers</em>.</li>
  <li>Set-builder notation:
    $$
    \{\,x : x \text{ has property } P\,\}.
    $$
  </li>
  <li>Example:
    $$
    \{\,x : x \text{ is a natural number between } 3 \text{ and } 15\,\}
    = \{4,5,6,7,\dots,14\}.
    $$
  </li>
</ul>


### Sets: Fundamental Concepts

Sets constitute the language in which modern mathematics is written.  
A *set* is a well-defined collection of distinct objects called *elements*.  
Sets are usually denoted by capital letters, while their elements are written in braces, for example  
 \{0,1,2,3\}.

#### Definition — Membership

Given a set $A$ and an object $x$:

- The notation \(x \in A \) means “$x$ is an element of \(A\).”
- Conversely, $x \notin A$ means that $x$ is **not** contained in $A$.

> **Example (notation in context):**  
>
> $3 \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, but $7 \notin \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.





### The Empty Set and Infinite Sets

The *empty set*, written $\varnothing$, contains no elements.  
Some sets are *finite*, while others contain *infinitely many* elements.  
For example:


\( \mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}, \)


where the dots (an *ellipsis*) indicate that the list continues in the same pattern.
