### Basic Terms

Sets are the building blocks of mathematics. Before diving into formal definitions, we recall some fundamental ideas and notation.

<ul style="margin-top:0.75rem; line-height:1.7;">
  <li>
    The notation \( \mathbb{N} \) denotes the <em>set of natural numbers</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We often specify sets by describing a property their elements satisfy, written in
    <em>set-builder notation</em>:
    $$
    \{\,x : x \text{ has property } P\,\}.
    $$
  </li>
  <li>
    For example,
    $$
    \{\,x : x \text{ is a natural number between } 3 \text{ and } 15\,\}
    = \{4,5,6,7,\dots,14\}.
    $$
  </li>
</ul>
