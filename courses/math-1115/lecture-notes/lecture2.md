# Lecture 2: Manipulating Numbers, Ratios, Percentages and Proportions



## Negative Numbers

Numbers that are less than 0 are called *negative numbers*.  
Handling their signs correctly is essential across algebra, calculus, and even data science.


### Addition and Subtraction

> #### Sign Rules for \( + \) and \( - \) *(Quick Reference)*
>
> | Operation | Rule (Result Sign) |
> |------------|--------------------|
> | \( + \) or \( - \) | Positive ± Positive → Positive or Negative as usual |
> |  | Positive + (Negative) → Subtract, keep sign of larger magnitude |
> |  | Negative + (Negative) → Negative |
