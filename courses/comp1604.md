# COMP 1604 — Discrete Mathematics

Welcome to COMP 1604. This course develops the mathematical foundations for computer science: rigorous logic, proof techniques (especially induction), counting, relations/graphs, and discrete structures used across algorithms and data.

## Overview
- **Topics:** propositional & predicate logic, sets & operations, functions & relations, equivalence & partitions, **mathematical induction** (weak/strong), Pigeonhole Principle, counting rules, permutations & combinations, binomial theorem, introductory graph theory.
- **Primary text:** Susanna Epp, *Discrete Mathematics with Applications* (any recent ed.).
- **Software:** Lightweight use of Python for examples (optional).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of COMP 1604, students will be able to:
1. Translate real statements to formal logic and prove/negate them correctly.
2. Write clear, rigorous proofs using direct, contrapositive, contradiction, and **induction**.
3. Apply counting principles and the Pigeonhole Principle to solve combinatorial problems.
4. Work with functions, relations, and equivalence classes; construct and use partitions.
5. Use basic graph concepts in reasoning about networks and algorithms.

## Assessment (typical)
- Weekly/bi-weekly **assignments** (30%)
- **Midterm** (20%)
- **Project/Applied task** (10%)
- **Final exam** (40%)

> Exact weights/dates will be confirmed in class and posted under **Assignments**/**Exams**.
