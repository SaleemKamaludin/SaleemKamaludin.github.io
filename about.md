# About Me

Hello, I’m **Saleem Kamaludin**, an educator in  Mathematics and Computer Science with a passion for teaching, research, and mentoring students at all levels.  
My work spans **graph theory, discrete mathematics, and applied computing**, and I am deeply engaged in developing accessible resources to support learning and exploration in mathematics.

---

## Teaching & Mentorship
I teach a variety of university-level courses in **mathematics, discrete structures, and computer science**.  
My goal is to create learning environments where students not only master technical skills but also develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

## Research Interests
- <a href="{{ '/notes/graph-theory/' | relative_url }}"><strong>Graph Theory & Invariants</strong></a> — Comprehensive notes from my MSc: Szeged, edge-Szeged, and Wiener indices; orbit partitions and cut-based computations; unicyclic, star-like, complete bipartite, and hypercube families; extremal/bounds results; chemical graph applications (alkanes),(Gutman, Polansky, Chang).
- **Mathematical Modeling** in natural and applied sciences  
- **Computational Tools** — Python, Mathematica, and LaTeX for research and teaching



---

## Beyond Academia
Outside of formal teaching and research, I design **educational materials, worked solutions, and guided notes** to help students bridge the gap between classroom theory and practical applications.
