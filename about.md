# About Me

Hello, Iâ€™m **Saleem Kamaludin**, an educator in  Mathematics and Computer Science with a passion for teaching, research, and mentoring students at all levels.  
My work spans **graph theory, discrete mathematics, algebraic topology and applied computing**, and I am deeply engaged in developing accessible resources to support learning and exploration in mathematics.

---

## Teaching & Mentorship
I teach a variety of university-level courses in **mathematics, discrete mathematics, and computer science**.  
My goal is to create learning environments where students not only master technical skills but also develop critical thinking and problem solving abilities.

## Research Interests
- <a href="{{ '/notes/graph-theory/' | relative_url }}"><strong>Graph Theory & Invariants</strong></a> â€” Comprehensive notes on the Szeged, edge-Szeged, and Wiener indices; orbit partitions and cut-based computations; unicyclic, star-like, complete bipartite, and hypercube families; extremal/bounds results; chemical graph applications (alkanes),(Gutman, Polansky, Chang).
- <a href="{{ '/courses/graduate/mathematical-modelling/' | relative_url }}"><strong>Mathematical Modelling</strong></a> â€” Practice-driven models across natural & applied sciences: ODE/PDE and discrete-time systems, nondimensionalisation, optimisation (LP/network flows), stochastic/Monte-Carlo simulation, and data-driven calibration/validation. Case studies reflect my work in business operations and pricing (break-even, elasticity), queueing & inventory, epidemic SIR/SEIR dynamics, and pharmaceutical surveillance using the counterfeit-drug dataset.

## Beyond Academia
Outside of formal teaching and research, I design **educational materials, worked solutions, and guided notes** to help students bridge the gap between classroom theory and practical applications.
