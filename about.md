## Saleem Kamaludin

I am a mathematician and university lecturer with interests in **discrete mathematics**, **graph theory** (with a focus on the Szeged index), and **mathematical pedagogy**.  

This site serves as a **hub** for my teaching and research material.  
- See the [Courses]({{ '/courses/' | relative_url }}) page for lecture notes and worked solutions.  
- Visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/SaleemKamaludin) for code, projects, and collaborations.
